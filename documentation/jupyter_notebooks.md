# Manage jupyter notebooks

We explain briefly how use jupyter notebooks with VScode.


## Install

```
pip install jupyter==1.0.0
```

## Set up
Launch jupyter in other window:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Create jupyter notebook

Create a notebook via command pallete in vscode (Create new blank jupyter notebook) save it where we want (we have already saved a notebook for EDA in `src/notebooks/EDA_MCPL_data.ipynb`).
